The Breast Cancer Diagnostic Dataset is a structured medical dataset used to analyze and predict the nature of breast tumors. It is primarily designed for binary classification, where tumors are classified as Malignant (cancerous) or Benign (non-cancerous) based on several computed features derived from breast mass images.
